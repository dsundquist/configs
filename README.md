## My Configs

### .zshrc

The prompt that I use.  It shows the current date and time in UTC.  Useful when you work with logs or a global team.

Example: 

```
[06-10 19:22:49Z] ~ >
```

### .vimrc

This is the vimrc that I use.  It was in part taken from here: [MIT The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

### .tmux.conf

I regularily use a MAC, and if you use the default prefix (ctr-b) for window resizing ctrl-up doesn't work, ctrl-up on a MAC (by default is Mission Control).

This remaps the the window resizing to the vim arrow keys (down, up, left, right; h, j, k, l).
